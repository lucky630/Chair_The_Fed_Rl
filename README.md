4. history data used for training and used in the experience replay to train.
5. state is partially observable (POMDP) bcz we don't know about other agents and there behaviour or account balances. so the state is the derivation of the actual state.
6. there is history of all recent investment and money movement.
7. Banks convert short-term deposits into long-term loans so there is more liquidity crisis if some customer come and ask for the high value deposit money.there is a need of funds and working capital to be available at right time & at right place.nearly every transaction has effect on the liquidity of the bank.
8. don't want to hold too much amount of cash money.that money can be used in buying other assets and providing loans to the customer.
9. liquidity ratio- BASEL-3 liquidity ratio amount of money bank hold in cash or other liquid assets / short-term obligations.more liability then assets then you are bankrupt.
